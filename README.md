# Monster Job Posting Scraper
## Description
The user can search for basic key words / location on Monster.com, then copy that URL (with all of the jobs expanded), as an argument for the Python script.

A CSV file (job_postings.csv) is created with the Position, Company, Description, Link, Location, Time Posted.
- The file will be overwritten each time the script is run... so rename any csv's that need saved for later
- Allows for the user to search for more specific keywords by opening the CSV in Excel/similiar program

There is a wait time between Job Description loads, so the script take some time... but better than clicking through everything :D
